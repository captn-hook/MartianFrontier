The players are band of lawless wasters. They scavenge what they can find, steal what they cannot, and live in temporary tents, hidden near rocky formations. They have light gear and weapons already, and a 1000$ between them.

They have heard that an APC full of relief good is making its way to Planitia Mesa, a fairly large mining village. The town recently suffered a worm infestation, and called for aid from Holdovers Hollow, the nearest space port. 

The APC, looking to make haste, has taken a route through a small canyon. After getting word from another band of wasters about the potential score headed their way, they gear up at a trading caravanserai and go to stake out the canyon. 

They can buy pretty much everything, but prices are rather steep. They can also look the trade or promise some of the loot to vendors, in order to negotiate.
Special things to look out for are: mines, rocket launchers, explosives, or a vehicle

Some of the party know the canyon well, it is steep walled and very narrow, and the APC will have little room to maneuver. Being a military vehicle, it is somewhat capable of off roading, but will be rather slow in the canyon. 

The canyon can be collapsed, the APC can be blocked, or it can be immobilized. 

Once the APC is disabled, or the soldiers are confident they can fight whatever is outside, they come spilling out.

Around 6 [[Soldiers]] and a [[Guard Captain]] come out of the APC. A pilot remains in the vehicle, and does not try to fight the players.
