Captured Stars are harvested by large industrial ships, away for years at a time just to collect a few hundred small stars.

They are the most powerful form of fuel available in the solar system. They power all forms of star ship, and even some towns.

There are even rumors of some [[Multi-Star Ships]] being produced by the [[Naval Schools]]
