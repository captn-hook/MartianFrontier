Outside the small rock formation, a hulking vehicle is parked on the sand. 
Harold Ja'quez has the largest rover in town. It sits only slightly taller than the other rovers, but is a full 2 square city blocks. The top and sies appear to be covered in pieces of rock and glued down dust, to disguise this slow moving behemoth from any ariel patrols.

This huge, tracked industrial complex sifts the Martian dust beneath it to extract what little moisture is available. 

Can buy water and medium info.
