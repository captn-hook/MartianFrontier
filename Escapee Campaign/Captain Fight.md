Captain does not need to die- he can remain with the party, and will be trying to reach the settlement, with the artifact in tow.

Captain Jacobs is from the Lunar Academy on earth, and is the second son to an aristocratic family. Even being the second son, people seem to think he could have done a lot better than piloting liners.

He has no shooting skill, so his shooting dice is a d4 - 2. But, as a wild card he will also roll a d6 - 2.

Captain Jacobs planned the sinking of the Misty Marvel, piloting it into a collision course, removing the black box, and locking all escape pods. His goal? A clean exit, with a relic hunted across both planets. He does not know what it is, only the rumors connecting the great people of this day and age to similar artifacts, across both Earth and Mars.
