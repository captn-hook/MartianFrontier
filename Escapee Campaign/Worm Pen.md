You walk up to a set of collapsible panel pens, next to a dinky little rover. 

Kellogg Cakes is sitting a plastic chair smoking a cigarette outside the rover.

Can get light info about the Saurian camp, and he offers a worm "taming" job.
Worm taming involved going and grappling a few worms outside of town.
