20 - 30 mins 

The enemy is looking to assemble the artifact!!
A frontal assault on this temporary hideout is led my [[Sally Stormtrooper.pdf]].
The caravans start closing up with surprising speed among the shooting, rolling out through several different exits. They barely return fire, except for the moisture farmer, who's big automated guns thunder at anyone taking a peak at him.

Sally rides through town with her 9 soldiers across 5 buggy's. They will stop and confront the players, retreating with the buggy's if overwhelmed.
