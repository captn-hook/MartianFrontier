[[1. Intro]]

10 - 15 mins

The box contains a large [[Magic]] artifact 

Natives soon find the party in the desert, and try to claim the magic artifact.

[[Native Fight]]

From them, the part can discover that a nearby settlement has another piece of the complete artifact.
And, the native tribes have a fortress around the artifact "Slot" 

This sets up the part to side with natives or with the settlers-
(secretly, the settlers are mostly android)

Whoever they side with- final battle is an assault on the enemy base.
