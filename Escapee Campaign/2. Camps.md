[[1. Intro]]

Despite your luck in making it off the liner, you only have barely enough fuel to avoid crashing into the planet. Your landing spot looks like it will be the middle of nowhere, out in the Amazonis Planitia. Luckily, there is a small settlement only a few days drive from your projected landing zone.

The box contains a large [[Magic]] artifact:
The stone ring segment inside the wooden crate must weight tons. The crate itself is roughly 8x4, containing a cracked ring segment that must belong to something like a 20 foot ring! On the surface, you see thousands of intricate, individual runes. On the inside edge, you see an inlaid metal ring, seemingly unscratched and weirdly undamaged at the ends.

Party sets out on their trek towards the city, driving the escape pod in recovery mode.

Natives soon find the party in the desert, and try to claim the magic artifact. Failed notice checks lead to the natives getting The Drop on the party.

[[Native Fight]]

From them, the part can discover that a nearby settlement has another piece of the complete artifact, from a captive or dead raider.

And, the native tribes have a fortress around the artifact "Slot" 

They now can choose to try to meet the natives or continue to the settlement.

(This sets up the part to side with natives or with the settlers)
(secretly, the settlers are mostly android)

(Whoever they side with- final battle is an assault on the enemy base.)
