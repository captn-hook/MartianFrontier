This gun store sells small personal defense weapons, as well as flame throwers for pest control. The purveyor is a full on robot, not like the androids you commonly see around. He seems to slide side to side behind his counter, and operates more like a vending machine than a sentient being.

He calls himself, Son of [[KillDozer]], and refuses to elaborate on who or what KillDozer is.
